The [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/) (GO) is a structured vocabulary of biological functions. The ontology is divided into three domains: biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. In total, the ontology contains over 40,000 terms. GO annotations link a gene to a specific GO term to indicate when a gene is associated with a specific biological function.

GO annotations are frequently incorporated into bioinformatics analyses; however, parsing the ontology and annotations can be difficult. This website aims to simplify the process of retreiving GO annotations. The annotations are current (see [last updated date](#last-updated)) and customizable to an individual user's needs. Annotations are provided separately for each species.

Please share any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports. The [project is open source](//github.com/dhimmel/gene-ontology) and contributions are welcome.
