+ **Evidence**: GO annotations are assigned [evidence codes](http://geneontology.org/page/guide-go-evidence-codes) denoting the type of work or analysis underlying a annotation. The default option includes annotations of all evidence codes. The second option restricts annotations to experimental evidence codes (`IEP`, `IPI`, `IMP`, `EXP`, `IGI` or `IDA`). While computational annotations [generally have](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002533) good accuracy, they can introduce biases when used to train other computational approaches.
+ **Propagation**: In general, genes (or gene products) are annotated to the most specific GO term possible. Propagation refers to transmitting a term's annotations to each ancestor of that term. We propagate along `is_a` and `part_of` relationships. For most use cases, propagated (inferred) annotations are desired.
